Static Sync
===========

A static HTML server that monitors the folder it was executed in for changes
and diffs them seamlessly into the browser without needing to reload the page.

Takes a "just works" approach by automatically injecting the synchronization
code.

### Installation

You can install via `yarn` or `npm`, below you will see commands to install
globally which is what is most commonly used for command line tools.

``` sh
# Using npm:
npm install static-sync -g

# Using yarn:
yarn global add static-sync
```

### Usage

If all goes well, you should now have a `static-sync` command in your `PATH`
which means you can execute it in the command line. Open an existing folder
with HTML files or make a new one and run this command in it. You shouldn't
see any output just yet, but the command should appear to hang.

Once you open your browser to: http://localhost:8000/ you should see the
`index.html` file or a directory listing to chose from.
